             The 'margin' variable is really an object, so we can call the
             elements within using dot notation like so: 'margin.top' returns
             '40', or 'margin.right' will return '40'.  */

          /* Let's start by making the x axis. We'll use a time scale, since
             we're plotting days. What this does is set 'x' to be a function that
             converts dates that we plug into it, into pixels on the canvas.

             The domain represents the minimum and maximum values that exist in
             the data. The range is the minimum and maximum values as
             represented on the web page. This is basically a date to pixel
             converter.
             For a great write up on how d3 scales work, look here:
               - http://www.jeromecukier.net/blog/2011/08/11/d3-scales-and-color/
          */
          var x = d3.time.scale()
            /* The minimum date is the first day I ate candy, the maximum date
               is the last day I ate candy. To calculate the first day, we can
               get the date from the data array: 'data[0].day' corresponds with
               the first element in the 'data' array (which is an object), and
               the value of that objects 'day' key.

               It's helpful to know what the data looks like. The json file looks like this:
                 [ 
                   {"day": "2015-11-01", "time": "17:25", "candy": "Heath Bar"},
                   {"day": "2015-11-01", "time": "17:25", "candy": "Kitkat Bar"},
                   {"day": "2015-11-01", "time": "20:25", "candy": "Kitkat Bar"},
                   {"day": "2015-11-02", "time": "17:38", "candy": "Whopper"}, 
                   ... 
                 ]

                 This is an array (designated with square brackets []) of
                 objects (designated with curly braces {}). The object consists
                 of names (day, time, candy) and their associated values. If we
                 assign the above to the variable 'array', we can access the
                 first element of the array with 'array[0]'. That would return
                 the first line above.

                 To access any element within the object, we can use dot
                 notation. 'array[0].day' would return '2015-11-01'.
                 'array[0].time' would return '17:25'. 'array[3].candy' would
                 return 'Whopper'.

                 *** What would array[2].time return? How would you get the
                 value "Kitkat Bar" (there are two ways)? ***

                 Since the json file is assigned to the 'data' variable, we can
                 get the first 'day' by accessing 'data[0].day'. We put that in
                 the default Javascript 'Date' function to return the date as a
                 String.
                 Getting the second day is similar. We can get the last day
                 from the data in the json file. We just need to get the last
                 object element in the array, and get the value of the day
                 element. But how do we specify which is the last element in
                 the array if we don't know how many elements there are? We
                 could count, but what if we change the data? We can do a
                 little math to calculate the last element in the array. The
                 Javascript builtin '.length' method gives us how many elements
                 are in an array. Since array elements begin counting at 0, we
                 just get the length, number of elements, minus 1 to give us
                 the index of the last element. We can then we put that into
                 d3's time.day.offset function which adds or subracts a given
                 amount of days from the day that you input. In our case we'll
                 offset by one day, so that the axis goes from the first day
                 until the day after the last day that I ate candy.
            */
            .domain([ new Date(data[0].day), d3.time.day.offset(new Date(data[data.length - 1].day), 1)])
            // The range is from 0 to 620 (700 - 40 - 40). Subtract margins for padding.
            .rangeRound([0, width - margin.left - margin.right]);

                 other day in the range).

              .ticks(d3.time.days, 1)
              // Sets the format for the tick to be a date in the form 'DDD ##'
              .tickFormat(d3.time.format('%a %d'));


          /* The y-axis represents how many candies eaten each day. The height
             of this axis is determined by the maximum number of candies eaten
             in a single day.

             A few times I ate multiple candies at the same time. We'll need to
             get the number of candies for each time period in a day and add
             them all up. This will determine the max height of the y axis.

             We'll use the d3 'nest' function which manipulates the data array.
             The 'key' function pulls out all of the separate days as a key,
             the value is all of the times that are associated with that day.
             We can then use the rollup function to turn the values into
             something else. In this case it returns the length of the values
             array, which is the number of candies eaten that day.

             The 'key' part of the 'nest' function turns the data from this:

                 [ 
                   {"day": "2015-11-01", "time": "17:25", "candy": "Heath Bar"},
                   {"day": "2015-11-01", "time": "17:25", "candy": "Kitkat Bar"},
                   {"day": "2015-11-01", "time": "20:25", "candy": "Kitkat Bar"},
                   {"day": "2015-11-02", "time": "17:38", "candy": "Whopper"}, 
                   {"day": "2015-11-02", "time": "18:38", "candy": "Whopper"}, 
                   ... 
                 ]

            Into this:

                [
                  {'key': '2015-11-01',
                  'values': [
                       {'day': '2015-11-01', 'time': '17:25', 'candy': 'Heath Bar'},
                       {'day': '2015-11-01', 'time': '17:25', 'candy': 'Kitkat Bar'},
                       {'day': '2015-11-01', 'time': '20:25', 'candy': 'Kitkat Bar'},
                  ]},
                  {'key': '2015-11-02',
                  'values': [
                       {'day': '2015-11-02', 'time': '17:38', 'candy': 'Whopper'}, 
                       {"day": "2015-11-02", "time": "18:38", "candy": "Whopper"}, 
                       ...
                  ]},
                  ...
                ]

            And the 'rollup' part of the the 'nest' function turns it into this:

                [
                  {'key': '2015-11-01',
                  'values': 3
                  },
                  {'key': '2015-11-02',
                  'values': 2
                  },
                  ...
                ]
          
         */

          var timesPerDay = d3.nest()
            .key(function(d) { return d.day; })
            .rollup(function(t) { return t.length; })
            .entries(data);

          /* The d3 'max' function looks at an array and returns the highest
             value. It takes an array and a function. The array is the
             'timesPerDay' array we created above. The function allows us to
             specify which part of the array to count. Here the 'v' stands for
             the array of day objects, and 'v.values' is the 'values' element
             within each day object, which holds the number of times a candy
             was eaten for that day. So 'd3.max' is now just looking at the
